I have been a Linux user since the early 2000s. I have long been looking for ways to help, it is now through translation that I contribute.

### Translation

* I'm the translation coordinator of [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) : [my profile](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jibecfed)
* I also help the global translation coordination of [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org): [see project's organization](https://github.com/YunoHost/project-organization#composition-des-groupes)

### To reach me

* I use IRC almost exclusively for meetings organized in advance. Don't look for me, because I can't access it when I'm at work, I can't use it on my phone and in case of a power failure, I can't retrieve the recent history of the discussion.
* I can be reached on XMPP at firstname@familyname.fr
* By email, you can also use the address firstname@familyname.fr
* Via mastodon, I'm using [@jibec at Mamot](https://mamot.fr/@jibec) and was before using Zaclys: [@jibec at Zaclys](https://mastodon.zaclys.com/@jibec).

### Some accounts

* Fedora: [https://badges.fedoraproject.org/user/jibecfed](Badges), [https://pagure.io/user/jibecfed](Pagure),
